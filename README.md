# Mobile-Sales-Analysis

## Project Background
Mobile Sales Dashboard is a data analysis project focused on uncovering key insights from a comprehensive 2024 sales dataset provided by a major mobile phone retailer operating across multiple countries. The company, whose name remains undisclosed, offers mobile phones through various sales channels including in-store purchases, online platforms, and third-party partners.

The dataset includes detailed records of transactions, customer demographics, product specifications, and geographic data. It captures valuable information such as device models, prices, storage sizes, colors, operating systems, customer age groups and genders, as well as sales channels and payment methods.

This project aims to analyze and visualize this data to identify trends, highlight high-performing products, and provide a deeper understanding of customer behavior. The resulting insights are intended to support strategic business decisions related to marketing, inventory management, and regional expansion.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Sales Trends & Channel Performance:** Examination of sales activity across different channels (online, retail store, partner) and time periods, with a focus on revenue, volume, and seasonal patterns.
- **Product Performance Analysis:** Assessment of mobile phone models based on price, storage size, color, and operating system to determine the best-performing products.
- **Customer Behavior Insights:** Analysis of customer demographics, including age group and gender, to uncover purchasing patterns and segment preferences.
- **Regional Sales Breakdown:** Evaluation of geographic trends to identify top-performing regions and potential markets for growth.

An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and visualize these findings and support data-driven business strategies can be found here:

Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for quality control and farmilarization with the dataset. To support time-based analysis across multiple visualizations, a **dim_date** table was created using **Excel** and joined with the facts data.
**Purpose:**
 - Enables month, quarter, and year breakdowns.
 - Facilitates trend analysis and time-based comparisons.
 - Supports cleaner date filtering and grouping in Power BI/Tableau.
   
‚úÖA relationship was created with the facts_sales data on the **date** field for all time-series visualizations and trend analysis.

## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
In 2024, the company‚Äôs mobile sales showed mixed performance, with steady overall revenue but notable fluctuations in monthly trends and unit sales. Key performance indicators (KPIs) reflect a competitive market influenced by consumer preference for premium devices and regional growth hotspots.

Total revenue for the year reached $14.5M, with 18,548 units sold at an average selling price (ASP) of $785. While overall performance was stable, a closer look at monthly data reveals critical insights.

   - This indicates a shift toward **high-end device purchases** ‚Äî possibly due to premium launches, promotions, or targeting high-value customers.
- **February vs March**
   - **March revenue fell to $1.17M** (‚ñº 15.2% from January).
   - Units sold in March: 1,375 (‚ñº only 2.6% from February).

# Mobile-Sales-Analysis

## Project Background
Mobile Sales Dashboard is a data analysis project focused on uncovering key insights from a comprehensive 2024 sales dataset provided by a major mobile phone retailer operating across multiple countries. The company, whose name remains undisclosed, offers mobile phones through various sales channels including in-store purchases, online platforms, and third-party partners.

The dataset includes detailed records of transactions, customer demographics, product specifications, and geographic data. It captures valuable information such as device models, prices, storage sizes, colors, operating systems, customer age groups and genders, as well as sales channels and payment methods.

This project aims to analyze and visualize this data to identify trends, highlight high-performing products, and provide a deeper understanding of customer behavior. The resulting insights are intended to support strategic business decisions related to marketing, inventory management, and regional expansion.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Sales Trends & Channel Performance:** Examination of sales activity across different channels (online, in-store, partner) and time periods, with a focus on revenue, volume, and seasonal patterns.
- **Product Performance Analysis:** Assessment of mobile phone models based on price, storage size, color, and operating system to determine the best and worst-performing products.
- **Customer Behavior Insights:** Analysis of customer demographics, including age group and gender, to uncover purchasing patterns and segment preferences.
- **Regional Sales Breakdown:** Evaluation of geographic trends to identify top-performing regions and potential markets for growth.

### Sales Performance:
- üîçPremium Sales Surge in February ‚Äî Revenue Held Strong Despite Lower Units
In **February 2024**, the business saw a standout trend: **mobile unit sales dropped sharply by 27.5%**, falling from **1,946 units in January to 1,411**, the **lowest monthly volume of the year**. Yet, **total revenue held nearly steady at $1.37M**, down just **2.9% from January‚Äôs $1.41M**. This anomaly signals a **significant spike in Average Selling Price (ASP)**, which reached **$973.10** ‚Äî the **highest ASP of the year**.

This trend highlights a **shift toward high-end device purchases**, suggesting that targeted promotions, flagship product launches, or premium customer segments drove revenue despite declining volume.

üìä Supporting Evidence:
- **January vs February:**
  - Revenue: $1.41M ‚Üí $1.37M (‚ñº 2.9%)
  - Units Sold: 1,946 ‚Üí 1,411 (‚ñº 27.5%)
  - ASP ‚Üë to $973.10 ‚Äî highest of the year

- **Compared to March:**
  - Revenue fell further to $1.17M (‚ñº 15.2%)
  - Units sold: 1,375 (‚ñº only 2.6%)
  - Suggests February was uniquely driven by **premium product sales**

- **October also saw a similar ASP-driven pattern:**
  - Revenue ‚Üë 32.0% while Units ‚Üì 13.3%
  - Another example of revenue growth not tied to higher volume

üí° **Takeaway:**
**Premium device sales can protect revenue even in low-volume months.** Replicating February‚Äôs success may involve:
- Releasing flagship models in Q1
- Offering high-margin bundles or loyalty upgrades
- Segmenting campaigns toward high-ASP demographics
